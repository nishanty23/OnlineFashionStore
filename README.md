# OnlineFashionStore 👗🛍️

Welcome to **OnlineFashionStore**, a fully responsive frontend fashion e-commerce website inspired by **Myntra**. This project was developed using **HTML** and **CSS** to enhance front-end development skills and explore modern UI/UX design practices.

## 📌 Project Overview

**OnlineFashionStore** is a clone-style shopping website that replicates the look and feel of a real-world online fashion store. It contains dedicated pages for different categories like **Men**, **Women**, **Kids**, **Home & Living**, **Beauty**, and **Studio**.

The website is fully static — focusing on layout, responsiveness, and styling using pure **HTML** and **CSS** (no JavaScript or backend).
